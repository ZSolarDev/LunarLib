# What *is* LunarPS(LunarParticleSystem/LPS)?
I want LunarPS to be a highly flexlble particle system for HaxeFlixel, *completely undefined* by default. I'm trying to give you control over ***EVERYTHING.*** you have control over the particle before it spawns, when it spawns, and every frame after it spawns. By default, it is a blank canvas, spawning particles in 1 spot. you can choose if they autospawn, and time between particle spawning; but that's all. You can even spawn your own batch of particles. To make effects easier, there is a particle system, which helps you manage multiple emitters; [Visit the wiki for more info.](https://github.com/ZSolarDev/LunarPS/wiki/Particles)

# How do  I use it?
1. There are some basic examples for Haxeflixel [here.](https://github.com/ZSolarDev/LunarPS/wiki/HaxeFlixel#-------lunarrenderer)
2. Read the wiki.

# What does it look like?
