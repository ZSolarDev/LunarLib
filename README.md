# What *is* LunarLib?
I want LunarLib to be something that can take features of a framework and make it better, maybe even optimizing it in the process. Currently, this only supports HaxeFlixel with these features:
- Ultra-customizable particles
- Improved renderer

My goal was to make me able to write code in lunarlib for 1 framework, and have it fairly similar across multiple frameworks. To make this work, I use render backends. Currently there is only a FlixelRenderBackend, rendering the shapes and bases you put on it to render. [Visit the wiki for more info.](https://github.com/ZSolarDev/LunarLib/wiki/Renderer) I wanted the code to be interfaced in a framework-general way(same across all frameworks) but this meant I had to refrain from using some good things specific to said framework, so it will vary a *little*. I will make a conversion page from framework to framework when we have more than 1 framework supported.

# How do  I use it?
1. There are some basic examples for Haxeflixel here[here.](https://github.com/ZSolarDev/LunarLib/wiki/HaxeFlixel#-------lunarrenderer)
2. Read the wiki.
