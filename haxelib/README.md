<h1 align="center" id="what-is-lunarps-">What <em>is</em> LunarPS?</h1>
<p align="center" >I want LunarPS(aka LunarParticleSystem/LPS) to be a highly flexlble particle system for HaxeFlixel, <em>completely undefined</em> by default. I&#39;m trying to give you control over <strong><em>EVERYTHING.</em></strong> you have control over the particle before it spawns, when it spawns, and every frame after it spawns. By default, it is a blank canvas, spawning particles in 1 spot. you can choose if they autospawn, and time between particle spawning; but that&#39;s all. you define how they move every frame, how/when they die(if they even die at all), you could give them a state system, you can give them physics, almost everything your mind can imagine! You can even spawn your own batch of particles. To make effects easier, there is a particle system, which helps you manage multiple emitters; <a href="https://github.com/ZSolarDev/LunarPS/wiki/Particles">Visit the wiki for more info.</a></p>
